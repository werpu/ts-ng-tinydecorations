# `ts-ng-tinydecorations` â€” A low footprint decorations/annotations set for angular 1.5+

This project has the aim to deliver a set of Angular 4 like typescript decorations for angular 1.5, with 
a low code footprint. So it is ideal for projects which want the simplifcation decorations
can deliver, but also do not want to much code.
While the project eases the porting of Angular 1.x apps to Angular 4. It is not its goal.
Its aim is more to make the code for Component libraries more readable, which need
a small footprint solution to be embeddable.

If you want top introduce an angular 4 decorations in an application, there are [solutions](https://github.com/ngParty/ng-metadata) with more
code footprint however which are more complete and closer to what Angular 4 delivers


TODO add more documentation the next days
